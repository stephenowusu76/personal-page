    <h2>About</h2>

    <p >
      Hello! My name is Stephen Adusei Owusu and I am a senior at Cornell University majoring in Information Science.
      I am passionate about writing code both FrontEnd and BackEnd projects. I am also interested in visualize and analyzing 
      data to uncover key insights.

    </p>
    <p>
      I worked with java web applications and React framework to create a new autocomplete tool to help users enter information
      into form while working for Zillow Group as an intern last summer.
    </p>
    <p>
      I am interested in tech, education and data science and would like to find opportunities in any of these fields. Thanks for 
      visiting my website. I look forward to connecting with you!
